To run just the detection code, use ```python testtesttest.py```

For the interface with the detection code, use ```python gui.py```

To run this, you need to install the  pyttsx3, pillow, opencv-python, tensorflow, and numpy packages.

This is just a proof of concept, so it isn't perfect yet, but it is mainly meant to demonstrate what the idea might do.
